# MattEland.ML
Extensions to improve productivity with Data Science and Data Analysis workloads on .NET

This is a suite of small libraries aimed at improving the developer experience using .NET for AI / ML workloads.

The libraries are still in development and may grow or shrink over time as more capabilities and polish make it into existing .NET workloads.

The current libraries under development are:

- [MattEland.ML.DataFrames](https://github.com/IntegerMan/MattEland.ML/tree/main/MattEland.ML/MattEland.ML.DataFrames) - Focused on working with the `Microsoft.Data.Analysis.DataFrame` and its columns.
